# PSET
This repository contains the code and data to reproduce the experiments presented in the Phonetics-Semantics Evaluation Testbed (PSET) paper. PSET is a testbed designed to evaluate the quality of phonetic embeddings by prioritizing phonetic information over semantic information, using a set of carefully curated word quartets.

Documentation to easily reproduce the experiments will be given soon.
